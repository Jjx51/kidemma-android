File to show folders in Git
// This file is intentionally left blank.
// It serves as a placeholder to ensure the directory structure is maintained in version control.
// You can add actual repository implementation files here later.
// For example, you might create a UserRepository.kt file to handle user authentication logic.
// Remember to remove this .gitkeep file when you add real files to this directory.
// .gitkeep is a convention used to keep empty directories in Git repositories.

// You can also use .gitignore files to ignore specific files or patterns in this directory if needed.
// More info: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
// Happy coding!
